() Past data has shown the rates of dysvascular amputations were on the rise. However, recent studies looking at single diseases of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) and Diabetes Mellitus commonly associated with dysvascular related amputations show that these conditions are now on the decline. We believe that it may not be a single disease process but rather the cumulative illness burden that is leading to amputations. In addition to etiology, age, gender, and race continue to play a role in limb loss. Limb loss is more common among older individuals, men, and non-whites. Trauma and cancer related amputations are on the decline and congenital amputations are unchanged in rates.},

	abstract = {Gesture recognition is a very essential technology for many wearable devices. While previous algorithms are mostly based on statistical methods including the hidden Markov model, we develop two dynamic hand gesture recognition techniques using low complexity recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms. One is based on video signal and employs a combined structure of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an RNN. The other uses accelerometer data and only requires an RNN. Fixed-point optimization that quantizes most of the weights into two bits is conducted to optimize the amount of memory size for weight storage and reduce the power consumption in hardware and software based implementations.},
